    "### 1. What is statistics, and why is it important?\n",
    "Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.  \n",
    "**Importance**: Helps in decision-making, understanding trends, making predictions, and validating hypotheses in various fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What are the two main types of statistics?\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize and describe the features of a dataset.\n",
    "- **Inferential Statistics**: Make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are descriptive statistics?\n",
    "They summarize and organize characteristics of a dataset. Includes:\n",
    "- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)\n",
    "- Measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is inferential statistics?\n",
    "It uses a sample to draw conclusions about a population. Includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is sampling in statistics?\n",
    "Sampling is selecting a subset from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Types of sampling methods\n",
    "- Random sampling\n",
    "- Stratified sampling\n",
    "- Systematic sampling\n",
    "- Cluster sampling\n",
    "- Convenience sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Random vs Non-random sampling\n",
    "- **Random**: Each individual has an equal chance.\n",
    "- **Non-random**: Based on judgment or ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Qualitative vs Quantitative Data\n",
    "- **Qualitative (Categorical)**: e.g., gender, color\n",
    "- **Quantitative (Numerical)**: e.g., age, height\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Types of data in statistics\n",
    "- **Nominal**: Categories, no order (e.g., blood type)\n",
    "- **Ordinal**: Categories with order (e.g., level of satisfaction)\n",
    "- **Interval**: Order with meaningful difference, no true zero (e.g., temperature in ¬∞C)\n",
    "- **Ratio**: Like interval with a true zero (e.g., weight, age)\n"
